function [thim] = adaptfiltim(varargin)
%   ADAPTFILTIIM Performs adaptive filtering of image
%
%   ADAPTFILTIIM(I,RAD,D,H) Adaptive filtering on I, RAD defines the filter size 
%   of average filter in relation to the units of the voxel size. D is 
%   the additive value above background value, can be set to 0.02-0.2. H is 
%   the voxelsize  
%   Image should be scaled to [0 1] before entering the algorithm.
